# Welcome to the algebend wiki!
I want this project to become the first algebra library for the bend language

## The roadmap of this project is :

1. propose basic algebra operation like scalar product, sum of vectors ...
2. propose basic matricies operations like sum, product, determinant ...
3. propose more advanced operations on matricies
4. consider "higher order matricies"
## What do I call "higher order matricies"
Let A_m,n a matrix with m rows and n columns, a higher order matrix B could be written as follows : B_m,n,o,p,... and would have m elements along 1 direction, n along another orthogonal direction, o elements along another orthogonal direction ...
